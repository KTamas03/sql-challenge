## About
The purpose of this project is to create a SQL database to hold data from csv files relating to employee information. The data was then manipulated to perform some analysis.

In this project, the following programs/software are used:
- Microsoft Excel: to view csv files.
- QuickDBD: to sketch and Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) of the tables in the csv files.
- PostgreSQL: PostgreSQL, which people typically refer to as just Postgres, is a relational database management system (RDBMS). An RDBMS consists of tables and their predefined relationships. Postgres stores the data.
- pgAdmin: The pgAdmin tool functions as the window into your database. It's where you write your queries, run those queries, and then review the results of running them. pgAdmin provides access to that data.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Installing
To install PostgreSQL & pgAdmin: 
- In your browser, go to Download PostgreSQLLinks: https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads.
- Select the download option for your operating system and the latest version 14.x of PostgreSQL.
- After downloading the latest version of PostgreSQL 14.x, double-click the postgresql-14.7-2-windows-x64.exe file. Note: The exact file version may be slightly different.
- Go through the Setup Wizard and install PostgreSQL. Keep the default location C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\14.
- Select the components to be installed. Uncheck the option to install Stack Builder.
- Add your data directory. Keep the default location C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\14\data.
- Enter postgres as the password. Be sure to record this password for future use.
- Keep the default port as 5432. In the Advanced Options, set the locale as [Default locale].
- The final screen will be the Pre Installation Summary.
- When you are done, the Postgres 14 folder can be accessed from the Start menu of your computer.
  - This folder contains the pgAdmin 4 application.
  - To confirm the installation, start pgAdmin (this will open in a new browser window). Connect to the default server by clicking on it and entering the password if prompted.
